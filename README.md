# HOLLOW POINT

A Hollow Knight mod that gives the Knight the ability to wield a modern day assault rifle.
Why did I make this? I wish I knew too.

While this mod is not to be taken seriously, It still aims to make a semi-serious fun ranged weapon mod to capitalize on Hollow Knight's movement system.  

## FEATURES:
-	Swap between the Nail or the Gun, allowing you range killing power and the ability to fire it at all 8 directions.
- Ability to set the firing direction, allowing you to stay on target when someones above you.
- New healing/spell resource: ADRENALINE. Consume ADRENALINE to allow you to use powerful skills. Filling your ADRENALINE completely gives you class specific buffs to help you cover their weakness. When your ADRENALINE meter is full, keep attacking and you will automatically heal, forcing you to play as aggressively as possible.
-	Replaces/modifies base spells that changes depending on what special weapon you carry, effectively creating a small class system for added flavor.
  1. BREACHER, Applies close range weapons such as SMGs, Shotguns and spells meant to kill enemies as quickly as possible. 
  2. SABOTEUR, Balanced class carrying large capacity, quick charging weaponry and wide range chemicals for drawn out fights. (Default Class)
  3. OBSERVER, Heavy hitting class capable of using long range precision weapons and calling in airstrikes.
-	Passive soul regeneration, soul gained upon killing or damaging enemy, damage scaling, etc and more stats that differs from weapon to weapon.
-	Any damage you deal with your bullets will reset your dash/double jump, allowing you to stay on air as long as you keep hitting enemies.
- Firing below propels you! Use this to keep afloat above enemies while you pepper them, stay mobile during a fight or access areas you normally cant.
-	Heat and recoil mechanics, the longer you fire the more innacurate youll be, forcing you to fire at burst against farther targets.
-	80% of charms changed to mesh with the gun mechanics. These includes charms that gives you powerful buffs, weapon changing charms or defensive charms.
charms that were not changed much were either buffed, or found themselves being more effective tools for long range combat.
- Nail arts now have their own different abilities, giving them ranged power when you lack the ammunition to fight back.
-	Upgrading your nail also upgrades your gun, allowing them to scale through the game.
-	New save or loaded save compatibility, as well as uninstallation capability (better back up your saves regardless though).

## What it does NOT do:
- Adds new bosses, sprites, music or modifies any of them.
- Change charm cost values.
- Care about lore. 
- No seriously who cares about the lore.

## CONTROLS:
**CAST** = Swap between the Nail and the Gun.
**QUICK CAST** = Use spells, you can now use spells while the gun is equipped.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## MECHANICS:
##### Ammo System
The SOUL gauge is no longer related to spells, **the SOUL gauge is now the gun's pure ammo counter**

##### Adrenaline, Healing and Infusion
To promote more aggression, the healing system is changed along with the spells. you instead have an ADRENALINE bar, denoted by 3 dots on your HUD.
To gain adrenaline, simply keep attacking the enemy, **getting hit by enemies also makes you lose them**, so watch out.

You have a maximum of 3 Adrenaline points, and using spells will always consume all of it. The more Adrenaline consumed, the stronger your spell would be (for example, an OBSERVER class will call 3 extra artillery barrages for every point spent)

To heal, you need to charge up your adrenaline to max (3 points), while at its maximum, your adrenaline can still charge albeit at a slower rate. During this, damaging and charging while at full power will grant you 1 mask instead, **that means you can heal yourself back from 1 mask to full as long as you keep doing damage at max adrenaline charge.**

In addition, staying on 3 adrenaline points gives you a small buff depending on the charm or class you currently have.

##### Fire Mode
Tapping cast when it would normally use fireball will now **swap your fire mode**, there are 2 fire mode types
1. Omnitdirectional = Denoted by an 8 pointed arrow, this means you will fire at all 8 directions.
2. Cardinal = Denoted by a 4 pointed arrow, you will only fire at 4 directions, useful for accurate firing on the move.
NOTE: You do not need Vengeful Spirit/Fireball to change this.

##### Nail Arts/Dagger Arts
You will notice a dagger icon at the top, this just means you can use Dagger Arts. Using Nail/Dagger arts will cause to start a cooldown, the cooldown depends on the art itself.

##### Weapon Conversion Kits and Class Transfers
Some special charms are capable of giving you an entirely different gun with its own properties. These guns are capable of changing your currently class.
**You may only carry one of these conversion kits, equipping more than one will prevent you from firing**. 
You can also transfer the current class by a specific charm, that allows you for example, to use an SMG with the Observer abilities, if you equip the Observer transfer charm.
Note however equipping more than one of these will set you back to the gun's original class.

## Known Issues (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO READ)
- Bullets sometimes destroys walls, sometimes they dont. The checks feels inconsistent and I have no idea how TC determines what surfaces should get broken or not. at best just use the nail for these.
- THK/Pure Vessel sometimes do not get damaged, your bullets will past them on specific attacks, unable to fix.
- Massive Moss Charger is not affected by bullets, unable to fix, just stab them. 
- Gas attacks dont affect mosskin enemies, doesnt work either on vanilla, im not sure if this is a vanilla bug or a feature due to lore reasons. 
- Creating a new save in Godmaster will not show with the gun. To fix this, simply save the Godmaster save, quick to menu then load it again. You only need to do this once on a fresh save.
- Some issues posted by users are sometimes very rare and something thats not easy to replicate, if you find an issue, make sure its not due to a vanilla bug or from incompatibility with other mods.

## Possible Q&A:
##### Q: Why, just why?

A: The massive amount of fan art involving Hollow Knight characters with guns was asking for it and I just had to. Also while this mod did start out as my first modding joke, the reception of something as dumb as this was just too good of an opportunity to pass.

##### Q: Is this compatible with mod X or Y?

A: So far QOL, RANDOMIZER, HP Bars works without any weird oddities, but while it may TECHNICALLY work with other large overhaul mods such as Blackmoth/Redwing or Lightbringer, they change stuff that’ll conflict with my other changes too, so best to just use these major mods by themselves. Baseline would be that anything that alters the way charm behaves is out of the question. (Yes, this involves mods like Charm Overhaul or Exaltation, please)

##### Q: Is this safe to Install/Uninstall on an existing save?

A: Should be, this mod loads all of its stuff on the fly when you load/make a new save and it doesn’t do anything that would permanently affect the game. THAT SAID, you should ALWAYS backup your save when using mods. This applies to any mod really, better safe than sorry.

##### Q: Why did you change the resource system for the spells/healing?

A:  Due to some technical difficulty with the game's system, I found it easier to just make an entirely new resources meter. As for the healing system, I made it so because I wanted to promote the player to play as aggressively as they can, and to minimize the downtime of fights. If this ends up making the mod too hard to be unfun, then I am more than willing to do some adjustments.

##### Q: I think __________ can be improved/ and here’s my suggestion.

A:  I’m neither the most creative person nor do I have infinite free time so the charm ideas can be lame I know but if you do have inquires, just message me and I’ll see what I can do (depending on what the request is at least). 

##### Q: I think this charm is lackluster/I have suggestions on how it can be balanced/improved further. 

A: Please message me! I take suggestions with consideration. Just do note some charms I haven’t change as I dislike the idea of changing stuff for the sake of changing stuff.

##### Q: I found bugs (original joke haha).

A: If you find any, please message me of WHAT it is and HOW you got it, and I’ll try my best to address it.

##### Q: IS THE TITLE A GUNGEON REFERENCE??!!?111!?!?!.

A: No, a Hollow Point is an actual low penetration type bullet mostly used by law enforcement and I got from other games that incorporate that bullet type. But yes, I am aware of the Gungeon enemy and I have played Gungeon before. 

##### Q: Worst Boss?

A: Definitely Gatling Gull.
